## Hi there, I am Tam 👋
I am currently majoring in Financial Analysis and Investment at Foreign Trade University. I am on the journey of learning, exploring and developing myself, both academically and personally. I am particularly interested in understanding how financial markets work, analyzing data, and improving my problem-solving abilities.
I enjoy reading books, which helps me relax and also broadens my creativity. Recently, I have also been watching the Youtube channel of Duy Thanh Nguyen. I really admire him and appreciate the insights he shares. I hope he will continue making more videos so viewers like me can keep learning and getting inspired.
I also hope to find a senior or mentor to accompany me on my journey of personal growth and self-development.
